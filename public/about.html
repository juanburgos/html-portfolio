<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Juan Burgos.</p>

<p>Husband, dad, and caregiver of my mother. Which, I can say that they are the main reason that gets me up in the morning, tailgated by a truck load of coffee.</p>

<p>Originally from Puerto Rico where I worked as a musician and as a cook, we decided to move to Florida where I got the chance to work as a school cafeteria manager while transitioning to the mortgage industry with my wife.</p>

<p>After years of helping people buy their homes and moving to Granger -now that the mortgage industry has slowed down- I'm taking the opportunity to slow down myself, take care of my family and develop the skills needed to transition into a new career.</p>

<p>I'm terrible at sports, but I think they are fun to watch with the right crowd. I also like to buy more books that I can read in a reasonable timeframe. Outside of work, you'll find me cooking, gardening, listening to music, playing guitar or bass, reading, watching murder mysteries or anime, and enjoying brews and spirits all in the company of my family.</p>
